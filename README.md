# Opencv-projects
These are all my opencv programs that I have done. I have followed a youtube channel called ProgrammingKnowledge.

Further, I have developed great interest in image processing.

I believe SoC in 3D gestures will give the necessary exposure I require not only in the world of image processing but
also in python, opencv and pycharm. I am really excited and eager in learning new things.
