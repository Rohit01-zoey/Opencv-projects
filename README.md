# Opencv-projects
These are all my opencv programs that I have done. I have followed a youtube channel called ProgrammingKnowledge.

Further, I have developed great interest in image processing.

I believe SoC in 3D gestures will give the necessary exposure I require not only in the world of image processing but
also in python, opencv and pycharm. I am really excited and eager in learning new things.

I have done C, C++ and python. I had java for 10 th std ICSE so I am fluent atleast in the basics of Java.
